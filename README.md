# Module-2: PYTHON FUNCTIONS AND LOOPS

This repository focuses on essential Python programming constructs, including various types of functions and looping mechanisms for pattern generation and logical checks.

## Topics Covered

Each Markdown file provides detailed explanations and examples for the following Python concepts:

* **Built-in Functions: Binary Conversion**
    * Demonstrates the use of Python's built-in functions for converting numbers to binary format.
    * *Files:* `Built-in Functions-Binary Conversion.md`, `binfn.png`

* **Functions: Modulo Calculator**
    * Illustrates creating a custom function to perform modulo calculations.
    * *Files:* `Functions-Modulo Calculator.md`, `fnpy.png` (assuming this is a general function-related image)

* **Lambda Function: Addition of Two Numbers**
    * Explores the use of anonymous (lambda) functions for simple operations like addition.
    * *Files:* `Lambda Function: Addition of Two Numbers.md`, `lambadafn.png`

* **Looping (Patterns): Pascal's Triangle Generator**
    * Generates Pascal's Triangle using nested loops, demonstrating loop control and pattern generation.
    * *Files:* `Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator.md`, `pascal_triangle.png`

* **Loops: Palindrome Number check**
    * Implements logic using loops to check if a given number is a palindrome.
    * *Files:* `Loops-Palindrome Number check.md`, `palindrome.png`
